# Makeover Monday 
[Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a data visualization project in which new datasets are posted every week. 

## This Repository 
This repository contains visualizations from Tableau, Python, and R on a rotating basis. 

Visualizations are organized by year and week in separate folders named in  `yyww` format. 

The visualizations themselves can be found in the `viz.md` file of each folder, or by downloading and running the code yourself. 

## Process  
My general process goes as follows: 

1. Learn about the original visualization, the data, and its source. 

2. Explore the data. 

3. Replicate the original visualization. 

4. Create a new visualization. 

There will be varying degrees of completion each week, with my top priority being to produce a visualization. 

Progress is tracked in [this Github project](https://github.com/users/erntan/projects/2/views/1).
